"""
This module contains an implementation of ``cached_property`` for which the default behavior is to not block concurrent
access to the decorated method for separate instances of the class in which the method was defined.  The implementation
in the stdlib ``functools`` module behaves the way this implementation does when ``block_all`` is True.

Additional helpers are defined here for clearing the cached values so that they may be re-computed.
